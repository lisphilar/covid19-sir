## Clone CovsirPhy repository and install dependencies

Developers will clone CovsirPhy repository with `git clone` command and install dependencies with Poetry.

### Clone/Fork the repository

Please start by cloning the GitHub repository with git command.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir.git
cd covid19-sir
```

Or, fork the repository and run the following commands with your account name `<your account>`. "remotes/upstream/master" will be shown by `git branch -a`.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your account>/covid19-sir.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir.git
git branch -a
```

Before editing the codes, please fetch and merge the upstream.

```Bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

### Setup Python

Setup base Python with <https://www.python.org/downloads/> (Windows) or some commands (anyenv and so on, Linux/WSL/macOS).

### Install Poetry (Windows)

Then, please install Poetry, a package management tool, with command lien tools, including PowerShell.

```Bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
poetry --version
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry config --list
```

If you have `make` commands, run `make poetry-windows`. This is defined in "Makefile" of the top directory.

### Install Poetry (Linux, WSL, macOS)

Please use `make` command.

```Bash
make poetry-linux
```

### Install dependencies

To install dependencies with Poetry, run `make install` or the following commands before editing codes.

```Bash
pip install --upgrade 
poetry self update
poetry install
```

- New dependencies can be installed with `poetry add <name>` or `poetry add <name> --dev`.
- Un-necessary dependencies will be removed with `poetry remove <name>` or `poetry remove <name> --dev`.
- Start shell with `poetry shell; python`.
- Run python scripts with `poetry run` command, like `poetry run examples/scenario_analysis.py`.

## Issues

Kindly [create an issue](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/issues) when you want to

- ask a question
- request fixing a bug,
- request updating documentation,
- request a new feature,
- request a new data loader or new dataset,
- communicate with the maintainers and the user community.

Please ensure that the issue

- has one question/request,
- uses appropriate issue template if available,
- has appropriate title, and
- explains your execution environment and codes.

When requesting a new data loader, please confirm that the dataset follows ALCOA (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate) and we can retrieve the data with permitted APIs. If the data loaders included in this repository use un-permitted APIs, please inform maintainers. We will fix it as soon as possible.

## Pull request

If you have any ideas, please [create a pull request](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/pulls) after explaining your idea in an issue.
Please ensure that

- you are using the latest version of CovsirPhy,
- the codes are readable,
- (if necessary) test codes are added,
- tests were successfully completed as discussed later, and
- the revision is well documented in docstring (Google-style)/README and so on.

Please use appropriate template if available, and specify the related issues and the change.

We use GitHub flow here. Default branch can be deployed always as the latest development version. Name of branch for pull requests will be linked to issue numbers, like "issue100".

To update tutorials in documentation, please update ".ipynb" (Jupyter Notebook) files in "example" directory.

Update of version number and sphinx documents is not necessary for developers. After reviewing by assigned reviewers, maintainers will update them by editing "covsirphy/\_\_version\_\_.py" and "pyproject.toml" when merge the pull request.

## Run tests

Before creating a pull request, please run tests with `make pytest` or the following commands.

All tests:

```Python
poetry run flake8 covsirphy --ignore=E501
poetry run pytest tests -v --durations=0 --failed-first --maxfail=1 --cov=covsirphy --cov-report=term-missing
```

Selected tests:
(e.g. when you updated codes related to tests/test_scenario.py)

Run `make test target=/test_scenario.py` or commands as follows.

```Python
poetry run flake8 covsirphy --ignore=E501
poetry run pytest tests/test_scenario.py -v --durations=0 --failed-first --maxfail=1 \
    --cov=covsirphy --cov-report=term-missing
```

When you create a pull request to upstream repository, CI tools will test the codes with Python 3.8+. When development version number is updated (i.e. a pull request merged), CI tools will test the codes with the all supported Python versions.

## Versioning

CovsirPhy follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). However, the followings may be CovsirPhy-specific rules.

- Development version number will be updated, e.g. "1.0.0-alpha" to "1.0.0-beta", "1.0.0-gamma" (for closing an issue), "1.0.0-gamma-fu1" (for follow-up of pull requests to fix minor errors).
- When the revisions do not change the codes of CovsirPhy, version number will not be updated.

Maintainers will

- update [sphinx document](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/) with CI tools and `make docs`,
- update "pyproject.toml" and "poetry.lock" with `make update`,
- update "covsirphy/\_\_init\_\_.py" to update development or stable version number,
- update "pyproject.toml" to update stable version number,
- upload to [PyPI: The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), and
- create [a release note](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/releases) for major/minor/batch update.

Milestones of minor update (from X.0.Z to X.1.Z) are documented in [milestones of issues](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/milestones).
