<strong>CovsirPhy is a Python library for COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) data analysis with phase-dependent SIR-derived ODE models. We can download datasets and analyse them easily. Scenario analysis with CovsirPhy enables us to make data-informed decisions. </strong>

## Functionalities

- [Data preparation and data visualization](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_dataset.html)
- [Phase setting with S-R Trend analysis](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_phases.html)
- [Numerical simulation of ODE models](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_theoretical.html): SIR, SIR-D and SIR-F model
- [Phase-dependent parameter estimation of ODE models](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_quickest.html)
- [Scenario analysis](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_quick.html): Simulate the number of cases with user-defined parameter values
- [Predict the parameter valuse to forecast the number of cases.](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/usage_quick.html#Short-term-prediction-of-parameter-values)

## Inspiration

- Monitor the spread of COVID-19
- Keep track parameter values/reproduction number in each country/province
- Find the relationship of reproductive number and measures taken by each country

## Installation

The latest stable version of CovsirPhy is available at [PyPI (The Python Package Index): covsirphy](https://pypi.org/project/covsirphy/) and supports Python 3.7 or newer versions. Details are explained in [Documentation: Installation](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/INSTALLATION.html).

```bash
pip install --upgrade covsirphy
```

## Usage

Quickest tour of CovsirPhy is here. The following codes analyze the records in Japan, but we can change the country name when creating `Scenario` class instance for your own analysis.

```Python
import covsirphy as cs
# Download and update datasets
data_loader = cs.DataLoader("input")
jhu_data = data_loader.jhu()
# Select country name and register the data
snl = cs.Scenario(country="Japan")
snl.register(jhu_data)
# Check records
snl.records()
# S-R trend analysis
snl.trend().summary()
# Parameter estimation of SIR-F model
snl.estimate(cs.SIRF)
# History of reproduction number
_ = snl.history(target="Rt")
# History of parameters
_ = snl.history_rate()
_ = snl.history(target="rho")
# Simulation for 30 days
snl.add(days=30)
_ = snl.simulate()
```

## Developers

CovsirPhy library is developed by a community of volunteers. Please see the full list [here](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/graphs/contributors).

This project started in Kaggle platform. Lisphilar published [Kaggle Notebook: COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) on 12Feb2020 and developed it, discussing with Kaggle community. On 07May2020, "covid19-sir" repository was created. On 10May2020, `covsirphy` version 1.0.0 was published in GitHub. First release in PyPI (version 2.3.0) was on 28Jun2020.
