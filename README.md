<strong>CovsirPhy is a Python library for COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) data analysis with phase-dependent SIR-derived ODE models. We can download datasets and analyze them easily. Scenario analysis with CovsirPhy enables us to make data-informed decisions. </strong>

## Inspiration

* Monitor the spread of COVID-19 with SIR-derived ODE models
* Predict the number of cases in each country/province
* Find the relationship of reproductive number and measures taken by each country

Any suggestions with [Github Issues](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/issues/new/choose) and [Twitter: @lisphilar](https://twitter.com/lisphilar) are always welcomed. Questions are also great. Please refer to [Guideline of contribution](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/CONTRIBUTING.html).</strong>

## Installation

The latest stable version of CovsirPhy is available at [PyPI (The Python Package Index): covsirphy](https://pypi.org/project/covsirphy/) and supports Python 3.7.12 or newer versions. Details are explained in [Documentation: Installation](https://lisphilar.github.io/covid19-sir/INSTALLATION.html).

```Bash
pip install --upgrade covsirphy
```

Python 3.10 users may need to install `datatable` with the following before `covsirphy` installation per [Issue #1159](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/issues/1159).

```Bash
pip install git+https://github.com/h2oai/datatable.git
```

## Demo

Quickest tour of CovsirPhy is here. The following codes analyze the records in Japan.

```Python
import covsirphy as cs
# Data preparation,time-series segmentation, parameter estimation with SIR-F model
snr = cs.ODEScenario.auto_build(geo="Japan", model=cs.SIRFModel)
# Check actual records
snr.simulate(name=None);
# Show the result of time-series segmentation
snr.to_dynamics(name="Baseline").detect();
# Perform simulation with estimated ODE parameter values
snr.simulate(name="Baseline");
# Predict ODE parameter values (30 days from the last date of actual records)
snr.build_with_template(name="Predicted", template="Baseline");
snr.predict(days=30, name="Predicted");
# Perform simulation with estimated and predicted ODE parameter values
snr.simulate(name="Predicted");
# Add a future phase to the baseline (ODE parameters will not be changed)
snr.append();
# Show created phases and ODE parameter values
snr.summary()
# Compare reproduction number of scenarios (predicted/baseline)
snr.compare_param("Rt");
# Compare simulated number of cases
snr.compare_cases("Confirmed");
# Describe representative values
snr.describe()
```

Output of `snr.simulate(name="Predicted");`

## Developers

CovsirPhy library is developed by a community of volunteers. Please see the full list [here](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/graphs/contributors).

This project started in Kaggle platform. Hirokazu Takaya ([@lisphilar](<https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar>)) published [Kaggle Notebook: COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) on 12Feb2020 and developed it, discussing with Kaggle community. On 07May2020, "covid19-sir" repository was created. On 10May2020, `covsirphy` version 1.0.0 was published in GitHub. First release in PyPI (version 2.3.0) was on 28Jun2020.
